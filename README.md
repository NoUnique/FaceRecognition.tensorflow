# FaceRecognition

This repository contains the demo for the face recognition models (FaceNet, MobileFaceNet). Pre-trained model weights are from followings: 
1. FaceNet(Inception-Resnet-V1) - [davidsandberg's implementation](https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet)
2. MobileFaceNet(MobileNetV2) - [sirius-ai's implementation](https://github.com/sirius-ai/MobileFaceNet_TF)

Additional models and code for model training may will be added later.

## Dependencies

This repository contains [container-based DL development environment](https://github.com/NoUnique/devenv.docker) submodule as a `docker` directory
Follow the instructions of the submodule.
